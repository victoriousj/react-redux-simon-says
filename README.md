## About

The game is the first React application that I made from scratch. It was boot-strapped with Create-React-App, which I found works very well with Github Pages. 

This application works well in browsers of all sizes and is heavily responsive to browser changes.

One thing that I took away from this is the use of React's Refs in order to trigger button presses from the main app component. Referencing child components from the parent is not exactly in-line with React's uni-directional data-flow, so it was interesting to have to use.
